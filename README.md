# hello-world
My first repository

Hello world, this is my first time jumping into the coding world, but I am committed and will not stop until I have mastered the art or at least learned as much of it as I can to design and develop apps and websites with ease. 
Everyday there is something new to be learned and everyday should have a new learning experience. 
Today I am fully committed to learning the new skills. The language of the computers!!
